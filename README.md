This is the repository for the Python and coding sessions at [AIFI bootcamp](https://www.aifinanceinstitute.com/-Bootcamp).

## Getting started

The easiest way to use the code of this repo is to install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
In the repo is a bash script `install_venv.sh` prepared for you to easily install the needed libraries.
However, before you can run this script, you need to make it executable. You can do that by running the command
`chmod +x install_venv.sh` in your terminal.
After that, you can run the script by typing `./install_venv.sh` into your terminal.

## Using the Jupyter Notebooks

To use the notebooks, you can use your IDE's terminal or the terminal of your choice on
your computer. Just navigate to the repos folder start the  
virtual environment with `conda activate` and then use `jupyter notebooks` to start the server for
the Jupyter Notebooks.

## Using PyCharm as IDE

The notebooks use some custom functions which are located in the folder
`customslib`. To alter the code it is useful to use an IDE like
[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) for it.
